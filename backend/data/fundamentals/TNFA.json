Its MYMD-1 is a drug platform based on a clinical stage small molecule that regulates the immune system to control TNF-a, which drives chronic inflammation, and other pro-inflammatory cell signaling cytokines. The MYMD-1 is being developed to treat diseases and disorders marked by acute or chronic inflammation. The company's second drug platform, Supera-CBD, is being developed to treat chronic pain, addiction, and epilepsy. The Supera-CBD is a novel synthetic derivative of cannabidiol (CBD) and is being developed to address and improve the growing CBD market, which includes FDA approved drugs and CBD products not regulated as drugs. TNF Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was formerly known as MyMD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and changed its name to TNF Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in July 2024. The company was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland.", "fullTimeEmployees": 6, "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Ian  Rhodes CPA", "age": 51, "title": "Chief Financial Officer", "yearBorn": 1973, "fiscalYear": 2023, "totalPay": 162000, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Mitchell  Glass M.D.", "age": 72, "title": "President, Chief Medical Officer & Director", "yearBorn": 1952, "fiscalYear": 2023, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Robert  Schatz", "title": "Investor Relations Officer", "fiscalYear": 2023, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}], "compensationAsOfEpochDate": 1703980800, "executiveTeam": [], "maxAge": 86400, "priceHint": 4, "previousClose": 0.35, "open": 0.365, "dayLow": 0.3524, "dayHigh": 0.444, "regularMarketPreviousClose": 0.35, "regularMarketOpen": 0.365, "regularMarketDayLow": 0.3524, "regularMarketDayHigh": 0.444, "payoutRatio": 0.0, "beta": 2.533, "volume": 7339418, "regularMarketVolume": 7339418, "averageVolume": 660768, "averageVolume10days": 955300, "averageDailyVolume10Day": 955300, "bid": 0.3413, "ask": 0.3478, "bidSize": 1, "askSize": 1, "marketCap": 1217465, "fiftyTwoWeekLow": 0.325, "fiftyTwoWeekHigh": 3.5, "fiftyDayAverage": 0.56314, "twoHundredDayAverage": 1.318505, "trailingAnnualDividendRate": 0.0, "trailingAnnualDividendYield": 0.0, "currency": "USD", "tradeable": false, "enterpriseValue": -8983868, "profitMargins": 0.0, "floatShares": 2453993, "sharesOutstanding": 2755070, "sharesShort": 777108, "sharesShortPriorMonth": 575440, "sharesShortPreviousMonthDate": 1739491200, "dateShortInterest": 1741910400, "sharesPercentSharesOut": 0.2821, "heldPercentInsiders": 0.0058600004, "heldPercentInstitutions": 0.15100999, "shortRatio": 1.18, "shortPercentOfFloat": 0.3154, "impliedSharesOutstanding": 2797810, "bookValue": 6.728, "priceToBook": 0.065680735, "lastFiscalYearEnd": 1703980800, "nextFiscalYearEnd": 1735603200, "mostRecentQuarter": 1727654400, "netIncomeToCommon": -28916932, "trailingEps": -13.54, "lastSplitFactor": "1:30", "lastSplitDate": 1707955200, "52WeekChange": -0.80355555, "SandP52WeekChange": 0.08089435, "quoteType": "EQUITY", "currentPrice": 0.4419, "recommendationKey": "none", "totalCash": 10641834, "totalCashPerShare": 3.863, "totalDebt": 18285, "quickRatio": 1.523, "currentRatio": 1.721, "debtToEquity": 0.107, "returnOnAssets": -0.31012, "returnOnEquity": -1.4267501, "freeCashflow": -4208311, "operatingCashflow": -10144862, "grossMargins": 0.0, "ebitdaMargins": 0.0, "operatingMargins": 0.0, "financialCurrency": "USD", "symbol": "TNFA", "language": "en-US", "region": "US", "typeDisp": "Equity", "quoteSourceName": "Nasdaq Real Time Price", "triggerable": true, "customPriceAlertConfidence": "HIGH", "shortName": "TNF Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "longName": "TNF Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "preMarketChange": -0.0019000173, "preMarketChangePercent": -0.4299654, "preMarketPrice": 0.44, "regularMarketChange": 0.09190002, "regularMarketDayRange": "0.3524 - 0.444", "fullExchangeName": "NasdaqCM", "averageDailyVolume3Month": 660768, "fiftyTwoWeekLowChange": 0.11690003, "fiftyTwoWeekLowChangePercent": 0.3596924, "fiftyTwoWeekRange": "0.325 - 3.5", "fiftyTwoWeekHighChange": -3.0581, "fiftyTwoWeekHighChangePercent": -0.8737429, "fiftyTwoWeekChangePercent": -80.35555, "dividendDate": 1574640000, "epsTrailingTwelveMonths": -13.54, "fiftyDayAverageChange": -0.12123996, "fiftyDayAverageChangePercent": -0.21529277, "twoHundredDayAverageChange": -0.87660503, "twoHundredDayAverageChangePercent": -0.6648477, "sourceInterval": 15, "exchangeDataDelayedBy": 0, "prevName": "MyMD Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "nameChangeDate": "2025-04-01", "cryptoTradeable": false, "hasPrePostMarketData": true, "firstTradeDateMilliseconds": 1390487400000, "regularMarketChangePercent": 26.257149, "regularMarketPrice": 0.4419, "corporateActions": [], "preMarketTime": 1743597559, "regularMarketTime": 1743537600, "exchange": "NCM", "messageBoardId": "finmb_694917951", "exchangeTimezoneName": "America/New_York", "exchangeTimezoneShortName": "EDT", "gmtOffSetMilliseconds": -14400000, "market": "us_market", "esgPopulated": false, "marketState": "PRE", "displayName": "TNF Pharmaceuticals", "trailingPegRatio": null}
