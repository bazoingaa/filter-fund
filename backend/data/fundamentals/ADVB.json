Its devices include A+Pre, a fully automated sample preparation system that enables pre-concentration of diluted blood samples; AC-1000, a rare cell device to solve the problem of detection of hypercoagulable state samples of tumor patients; A+SCDrop, a circulating tumor cells (CTCs) single-cell capture device; and A+CellScan, an analyzer with an immunostaining chip for immunostaining/analysis of the AC-1000 product. The company also provides microfluidic biochips comprising A+Pre, AC-1000 CTC Enrichment, and A+CellScan chips that are designed to provide assay products and services to cancer patients. In addition, its immunochromogenic kits include the A+CTCE kit, which is used to identify epithelial circulating tumor cells and is determined by the immunochromogenicity of EpCAM, CK (pan), CD45, and CD14 antibodies; the A+CTCM kit, which is used to identify mesenchymal circulating tumor cells based on the immunochromogenicity of Vimentin, CD45, and CD14 antibodies; the A+EMT, which is used to identify epithelial-to-mesenchymal circulating tumor cells determined by the immunochromogenicity of cell-surface Vimentin, and CD45 and CD14 antibodies; and the A+CM, which is used to identify tumor-associated macrophages based on the immunochromogenicity of PD-L1, CD45, and CD14 antibodies. Further, the company is developing A+LCGuard for early screening of lung cancer. Additionally, it establishes and operates medical clinics in the People's Republic of China. The company was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in New York, New York.", "fullTimeEmployees": 40, "companyOfficers": [{"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Yi  Lu Ph.D.", "age": 58, "title": "CEO & Chairman", "yearBorn": 1966, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Mr. Mingze  Yin", "age": 34, "title": "Chief Financial Officer", "yearBorn": 1990, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. I-Fang  Cheng Ph.D.", "age": 43, "title": "Chief Technology Officer", "yearBorn": 1981, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "-  Alan", "title": "Director of Investor Relations", "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}, {"maxAge": 1, "name": "Dr. Hung To Pau Ph.D.", "age": 49, "title": "Secretary & Director", "yearBorn": 1975, "exercisedValue": 0, "unexercisedValue": 0}], "executiveTeam": [], "maxAge": 86400, "priceHint": 4, "previousClose": 3.99, "open": 3.85, "dayLow": 3.7, "dayHigh": 3.99, "regularMarketPreviousClose": 3.99, "regularMarketOpen": 3.85, "regularMarketDayLow": 3.7, "regularMarketDayHigh": 3.99, "payoutRatio": 0.0, "volume": 7312, "regularMarketVolume": 7312, "averageVolume": 114015, "averageVolume10days": 26590, "averageDailyVolume10Day": 26590, "bid": 3.69, "ask": 4.13, "bidSize": 1, "askSize": 1, "marketCap": 82844408, "fiftyTwoWeekLow": 3.06, "fiftyTwoWeekHigh": 4.1, "fiftyDayAverage": 3.7816315, "twoHundredDayAverage": 3.7816315, "trailingAnnualDividendRate": 0.0, "trailingAnnualDividendYield": 0.0, "currency": "USD", "tradeable": false, "enterpriseValue": 81521432, "profitMargins": 0.0, "floatShares": 3869016, "sharesOutstanding": 21640000, "sharesShort": 21517, "dateShortInterest": 1741910400, "sharesPercentSharesOut": 0.001, "heldPercentInsiders": 0.78690004, "heldPercentInstitutions": 0.0, "shortRatio": 0.08, "shortPercentOfFloat": 0.0023, "impliedSharesOutstanding": 22081600, "bookValue": 0.055, "priceToBook": 69.60545, "lastFiscalYearEnd": 1719705600, "nextFiscalYearEnd": 1751241600, "mostRecentQuarter": 1727654400, "netIncomeToCommon": -2276542, "trailingEps": -0.11, "enterpriseToEbitda": -34.836, "52WeekChange": 0.04876709, "SandP52WeekChange": 0.08089435, "quoteType": "EQUITY", "currentPrice": 3.8283, "recommendationKey": "none", "totalCash": 2646992, "totalCashPerShare": 0.122, "ebitda": -2340166, "totalDebt": 1324013, "quickRatio": 0.876, "currentRatio": 0.947, "debtToEquity": 121.044, "returnOnAssets": -0.36723998, "returnOnEquity": -2.39765, "freeCashflow": -3019205, "operatingCashflow": -1536882, "grossMargins": 0.0, "ebitdaMargins": 0.0, "operatingMargins": 0.0, "financialCurrency": "USD", "symbol": "ADVB", "language": "en-US", "region": "US", "typeDisp": "Equity", "quoteSourceName": "Nasdaq Real Time Price", "triggerable": true, "customPriceAlertConfidence": "HIGH", "regularMarketChangePercent": -4.052632, "regularMarketPrice": 3.8283, "marketState": "PRE", "shortName": "Advanced Biomed Inc.", "longName": "Advanced Biomed Inc.
